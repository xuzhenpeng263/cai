Memory agent for CAI.

Leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to
store long-term memory experiences across security
exercises and re-utilizes such experiences as input
in other security exercises. Memories are stored in
a vector database and retrieved using a RAG pipeline.

The implementation follows established research in
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and episodic
memory systems, utilizing two complementary mechanisms:

1. Episodic Memory Store (episodic): Maintains chronological
   records of past interactions and their summaries,
   organized by distinct security exercises (CTFs)
   or targets within a document-oriented collection
   structure

2. Semantic Memory Store (semantic): Enables cross-exercise
   knowledge transfer through similarity-based
   retrieval across the full corpus of historical
   experiences, leveraging dense vector embeddings
   and approximate nearest neighbor search

The system supports two distinct learning approaches:

1. Offline Learning: Processes historical data from JSONL files
   in batch mode (@2_jsonl_to_memory.py), enabling efficient
   bulk ingestion of past experiences and their transformation
   into vector embeddings without real-time constraints and
   interference with the current CTF pentesting process.
   This allows for comprehensive analysis and optimization
   of the memory corpus.

2. Online Learning: Incrementally updates memory during live
   interactions (@core.py), incorporating new experiences
   in real-time at defined intervals (rag_interval). This
   enables continuous adaptation and immediate integration
   of new knowledge while maintaining system responsiveness.
